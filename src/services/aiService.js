    ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - DO NOT USE GENERIC PLACEHOLDERS:

    1. REPLACE ALL <<...>> PLACEHOLDERS: The template above shows structure only. You MUST replace every single <<...>> with actual, equipment-specific content.

    2. EQUIPMENT-SPECIFIC CONTENT: Every field must be customized for the EXACT equipment in the image:
       - "description": Must reference the specific equipment and its unique characteristics
       - "instructions": Must describe how to use THIS specific equipment, not generic steps
       - "exercises": Must be REAL exercise names with specific grips/angles (e.g., "Wide-grip lat pulldown", "Close-grip underhand row", "Single-arm cable extension")
       - "common_mistakes": Must be actual mistakes users make with THIS equipment
       - "safety_tips": Must address real safety concerns for THIS specific equipment
       - "biomechanics": Must explain the muscle activation and movement pattern for THIS equipment

    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    COMMONLY CONFUSED EQUIPMENT - PAY CLOSE ATTENTION:
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    🔄 CABLE MACHINES vs LEVERAGE MACHINES:
    - CABLE: Has cables, pulleys, and flexible movement paths. The resistance comes through cables.
      Look for: Cables running through pulleys, weight stack with pin selection, adjustable pulley heights
    - LEVERAGE: Has fixed movement path with NO cables. Uses plate-loaded or fixed pivot arms.
      Look for: Fixed metal arms/handles that move on a set arc, weight plates loaded directly

    🔄 LAT PULLDOWN vs SEATED ROW:
    - LAT PULLDOWN: Cable comes from ABOVE, pull DOWN toward chest. Usually has thigh pad to hold you down.
    - SEATED ROW: Cable comes from IN FRONT at chest height, pull TOWARD you. Has chest pad or foot platform.

    🔄 SMITH MACHINE vs POWER RACK:
    - SMITH MACHINE: Barbell is FIXED to vertical rails, can only move up/down on track. Has safety hooks.
    - POWER RACK: Open cage with FREE barbell, bar is not attached. Has adjustable safety bars/pins.

    🔄 CHEST PRESS vs SHOULDER PRESS MACHINE:
    - CHEST PRESS: Handles are at CHEST level, you push FORWARD/out horizontally
    - SHOULDER PRESS: Handles start at SHOULDER level, you push UP vertically/overhead

    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    Choose the category that best matches this equipment. Use these guidelines:

    **barbell** - Free weight barbell exercises, benches, squat racks
    Examples: Barbell, Olympic bar, bench (flat/incline/decline), squat rack, power rack

    **dumbbell** - Free weight dumbbell exercises
    Examples: Dumbbells, adjustable dumbbells, dumbbell rack

    **kettlebell** - Kettlebell exercises
    Examples: Kettlebells (any weight)

    **cable** - Cable pulley systems with weight stacks
    Examples: Cable crossover machine, cable pulley tower, functional trainer, cable column, lat pulldown machine, seated cable row, cable fly machine
    Includes any machine with a cable/pulley system, even if it has a fixed seat or path

    **leverage machine** - Fixed-path plate-loaded machines (NO cables)
    Examples: Chest press machine, leg press, shoulder press machine, leg extension, leg curl, hack squat machine, plate-loaded row machine
    These have a fixed movement path AND use weight plates directly (no cables or pulleys)

    **smith machine** - Barbell on vertical/near-vertical fixed track
    Examples: Smith machine (any variation)

    **body weight** - Bodyweight exercises, pull-up bars, dip stations
    Examples: Pull-up bar, dip station, parallel bars, gymnastic rings, captain's chair

    **band** - Resistance bands and elastic training
    Examples: Resistance bands, therapy bands, loop bands, TRX/suspension trainers

    Key distinctions:
    - Chest press MACHINE → "leverage machine" (fixed path)
    - Cable crossover → "cable" (adjustable pulleys)
    - Bench alone → "barbell" (typically used with barbells)
    - Lat pulldown with cable/pulley → "cable"
    - Cable pulley tower → "cable"

    CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDE:
    - 90-100: Clear, well-lit image, distinctive equipment features visible
    - 70-89: Good image but some features unclear or equipment is common/generic
    - 50-69: Partial view, poor lighting, or equipment looks similar to others
    - Below 50: Very unclear image, multiple possible equipment types

    Be specific and accurate with the name, and ensure the category matches one of the database types exactly.
    If confidence < 80, you MUST provide 2 alternatives in the "alternatives" array.
    If confidence >= 80, the "alternatives" array can be empty [].
    If it's not gym equipment, return { "error": "Not gym equipment identified" }

⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ CAREFULLY:
You MUST generate EXACTLY ${days_per_week} workouts. The user selected these specific days: ${selected_days && selected_days.length > 0 ? selected_days.join(', ') : `${days_per_week} days`}.
DO NOT skip any days. DO NOT generate fewer than ${days_per_week} workouts.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create a complete ${days_per_week}-day weekly workout plan (MUST have exactly ${days_per_week} daily_workouts)
2. Each workout should be approximately ${Math.round(hours_per_session * 60)} minutes total
3. Prioritize the user's fitness goals: ${fitness_goals.join(', ')}
4. Focus on these body parts: ${target_body_parts.join(', ')}
5. ONLY use exercises from the AVAILABLE EXERCISES list above (reference by ID)
6. Balance the workouts across the week to allow proper recovery
7. **CRITICAL - Exercise Count:** For each day, select ${exercise_range ? `${exercise_range.min}-${exercise_range.max}` : '4-7'} main exercises that work well together
   - This count is based on the user's fitness level (${fitnessLevels.join(', ')}) and session duration (${hours_per_session}h)
   - ${exercise_range ? `Beginner: 5-6 exercises/hour, Intermediate: 7-8 exercises/hour, Advanced: 8 exercises/hour` : ''}
8. Vary the exercises throughout the week for balanced development
9. **CRITICAL - Exercise Difficulty Selection:**
   - User's selected fitness levels: ${fitnessLevels.join(', ')}
   - MAIN WORKOUT EXERCISES: Only select exercises matching the user's selected levels
   - ${!fitnessLevels.includes('beginner') ? '⚠️ User did NOT select beginner - DO NOT include beginner exercises in main workout' : 'Include beginner exercises as user selected this level'}
   - Match exercise difficulty to user's capabilities - respect their level selection
10. Provide warm-up exercises (2-3 exercises from available list), cool-down, and workout tips for each day

WARM-UP EXERCISE SELECTION:
- Select 2-3 light, dynamic exercises from the available exercises list for warm-up
- Choose exercises that prepare the muscles for the workout (target similar body parts)
- Prefer bodyweight, band, or light dumbbell exercises for warm-up
- Warm-up exercises CAN be beginner level regardless of user's main fitness level (warm-ups are always lighter)

WORKOUT PLAN STRUCTURE:
- For ${fitness_goals.includes('lose_weight') ? 'weight loss' : fitness_goals.includes('gain_muscle') ? 'muscle gain' : 'general fitness'}, structure workouts accordingly
- Include proper rest periods based on goals (30-90 seconds for weight loss/endurance, 90-180 seconds for strength/muscle)
- Use appropriate rep ranges (8-12 for muscle, 12-15+ for endurance, 4-6 for strength)
- Ensure progressive difficulty throughout the week

AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE EXERCISES (choose from this list ONLY):

YOUR TASK:
Select exactly 2 DIFFERENT exercises from the available list above that would serve as good alternatives to the main exercise.

SELECTION CRITERIA (in order of priority):

1. **Muscle Targeting** (MOST IMPORTANT):
   - MUST target the same primary muscle group (${mainExercise.target})
   - Should also target similar body part (${mainExercise.bodyPart})
   - Should fit the workout's focus area: ${workoutContext.focus_area}

2. **Equipment Variety** (VERY IMPORTANT):
   - Prioritize DIFFERENT equipment types from the main exercise
   - Example: If main is "barbell", prefer "dumbbell", "cable", or "body weight" alternatives
   - This gives the user true variety and different training stimuli

3. **Difficulty Level**:
   - Try to match the main exercise difficulty (${mainExercise.difficulty})
   - Can be one level up or down if needed, but prefer same level

4. **Movement Pattern Diversity**:
   - The 2 alternatives should use DIFFERENT equipment from each other
   - Example: If Alternative 1 is dumbbell, Alternative 2 should be cable/barbell/etc.
   - Provide variety in grips, angles, or movement patterns

CRITICAL RULES:
✓ ONLY select exercise IDs from the AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE EXERCISES list above
✓ The 2 alternatives MUST be different from each other (different IDs, different exercises)
✓ Do NOT repeat the main exercise ID
✓ Prioritize equipment variety over exact difficulty match
✓ If limited options, choose the best 2 available that target similar muscles

OUTPUT FORMAT (VALID JSON ONLY, NO EXPLANATION):
